Hi Pedro,
 
I hope you are doing well.  I’m happy to help answer your questions about how we performed your project.  Please see our description below:
 


Briefly, RNA was normalized according to the Excel file above.  To prepare the
libraries, GENEWIZ used the NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Preparation Kit according
to the Manufacturer’s instructions.  Final individual libraries were run on the
Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer to check insert size and quality according to the
Manufacturer’s instructions.  Next, individual libraries were re-quantitated
using Qubit according to Manufacturer’s instructions and pooled accordingly. 
Lastly, the final pool was re-quantitated using qPCR following KAPA SYBR Fast
Universal qPCR kit according to Manufacturer’s instructions.  The final pool was
clustered on the flowcell and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq2500 machine in the
2x50bp PE Rapid Run Mode according to Manufacturer’s instructions.

Please let us know if you have any additional questions.  Thank you and have a
great day.

Best Regards,
