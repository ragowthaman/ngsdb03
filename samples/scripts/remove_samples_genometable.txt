New field suggested_reference_genome is introduced into samples.library table.
This will now store the suggested reference name and version as char field
At the end, reference_genome_version and reference_genome fields should be removed.

from samples.models import *
from samples.models import Library as samplelibrary
libs = samplelibrary.objects.all()
for lib in libs:
	refversion = lib.reference_genome_version
	refcode = Genome.objects.get(pk=lib.reference_genome_id).reference_code
	lib.suggested_reference_genome = 'Reference Genome: ' + refcode + ';  version: ' + refversion
	lib.save()
